# fitness_app_SQL_the_2nd

# Description
This is a mirror image of my other fitness app, however I will use express & node for this one instead of supabase. The reason for this, is whilst I think supabase is a great tool and has a lot of built in functions, I would like to learn more about what is happening under the hood so to speak. That's why I've decided to do a "clone" project.

# Tech Stack
- React - for scalability and reusable components
- Typescript - there will be many types within the data
- Bootstrap - for frontend basic styling
- React Testing Library - for unit tests
- Cypress - for E2E user testing
- Express - manage servers and routes
- ElephantSQL - store the data
